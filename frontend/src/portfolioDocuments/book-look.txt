* Carolina Code School final project
* Goal: Create a word game that gives players random passages from random books, with blanks to fill in.
* Methods: Developed a React frontend and Django backend with SQL database. Uses downloaded Gutenberg transcription data to dynamically generate word games passages. Also has user authentication and login, and a points system for the game.
* Future plans: Improve the look and feel, make a scoreboard, give the option to choose chapters of the book (easier for classroom use).
